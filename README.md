# EVault
A small launcher program for Exodus wallet

Usage: Place the executable jar file or the .exe file in any directory or removable drive. 
When run, it will prompt for migration of the wallet to the location the executable is at. 
If an exodus install is detected on the computer but not in the directory the executable is, it will offer to move the install.


Windows: Just run the .exe file, it will prompt you if there are issues
Mac: run the jar file using the java launcher.
